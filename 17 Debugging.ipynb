Its return value is the new trace function, which is\n     |      usually itself. The default implementation decides how to\n     |      dispatch a frame, depending on the type of event (passed in as a\n     |      string) that is about to be executed.\n     |      \n     |      The event can be one of the following:\n     |          line: A new line of code is going to be executed.\n     |          call: A function is about to be called or another code block\n     |                is entered.\n     |          return: A function or other code block is about to return.\n     |          exception: An exception has occurred.\n     |          c_call: A C function is about to be called.\n     |          c_return: A C function has returned.\n     |          c_exception: A C function has raised an exception.\n     |      \n     |      For the Python events, specialized functions (see the dispatch_*()\n     |      methods) are called.  For the C events, no action is taken.\n     |      \n     |      The arg parameter depends on the previous event.\n     |  \n     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n     |  Data descriptors inherited from bdb.Bdb:\n     |  \n     |  __dict__\n     |      dictionary for instance variables (if defined)\n     |  \n     |  __weakref__\n     |      list of weak references to the object (if defined)\n     |  \n     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n     |  Methods inherited from cmd.Cmd:\n     |  \n     |  cmdloop(self, intro=None)\n     |      Repeatedly issue a prompt, accept input, parse an initial prefix\n     |      off the received input, and dispatch to action methods, passing them\n     |      the remainder of the line as argument.\n     |  \n     |  columnize(self, list, displaywidth=80)\n     |      Display a list of strings as a compact set of columns.\n     |      \n     |      Each column is only as wide as necessary.\n     |      Columns are separated by two spaces (one was not legible enough).\n     |  \n     |  complete(self, text, state)\n     |      Return the next possible completion for 'text'.\n     |      \n     |      If a command has not been entered, then complete against command list.\n     |      Otherwise try to call complete_<command> to get list of completions.\n     |  \n     |  complete_help(self, *args)\n     |  \n     |  completedefault(self, *ignored)\n     |      Method called to complete an input line when no command-specific\n     |      complete_*() method is available.\n     |      \n     |      By default, it returns an empty list.\n     |  \n     |  completenames(self, text, *ignored)\n     |  \n     |  emptyline(self)\n     |      Called when an empty line is entered in response to the prompt.\n     |      \n     |      If this method is not overridden, it repeats the last nonempty\n     |      command entered.\n     |  \n     |  get_names(self)\n     |  \n     |  parseline(self, line)\n     |      Parse the line into a command name and a string containing\n     |      the arguments.
